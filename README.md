# log4jeo

Geolocation of log entries

# Overview

We aim to consume Apache HTTPD access_log entries and display their distribution on a map (global or UK).
We also wish to take subsets of the data (e.g. 3 weeks ago until 1 week ago) and display this subset distribution.

# Suggested Technologies (subject to change)
Clojure 
Compojure
Incanter
Datomic
